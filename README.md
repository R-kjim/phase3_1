## Overview
This repository is an assessment in python covering:
    Basic data structures,
    Functions,
    Decorators,
    Sequences,
    Sets, Dictionaries and 
    Object-Oriented Programming

## Files
    challenges.py -contains well written solutions to assessments in the above fields.

## challenge.py functions implemented
1. Function: add_numbers(num1,num2)
    returns the sum of the two numbers.

2. Function: is_even(num)
    returns True if num is even, and False otherwise.

3. Function: reverse_string(string)
    returns the reversed version of string.

4. Function: count_vowels(string)
    returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.

5. Function: calculate_factorial(num)
    returns the factorial of num for non-negative inputs  of num 

6. Function: apply_decorator(func)
    takes in a function func as input and applies a decorator named decorator_func. The decorator should simply print "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.

7. Sequences: Sort List of Tuples  
    Function: sort_by_age(list_of_tuples)
        each tuple in list_of_tuples contains a name and an age.
        sort_by_age sorts the list of tuples by age in ascending order.

8. Function: merge_dicts(dict1,dict2)
    merges two dictionaries into one,adding values where keys are common

9. Object-Oriented Programming: Class Creation
    A class named Car with the following attributes: make, model, year. Implements a method named display_info that prints out the car's information.# phase3_1
